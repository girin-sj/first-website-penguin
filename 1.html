    <h1>PENGUIN에 대해서 알아봅시다</h1>

     <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/facts/penguins-1" target="_blank" title="national geographic">Penguins</a> are a group of <strong>aquatic <u>flightless</u> birds</strong>.
    <p style="margin-top:10px;"> They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, the Galápagos penguin, is found north of the Equator.
    Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming.</p>

    <p> Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow it whole while swimming.
    A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey. </p>
